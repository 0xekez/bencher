- `/iperf-sender-9000`

Listens for tcp connections on port 8657. Programs that would like to
have an iperf3 test sent to them connect and send an address that they
would like the program to run a test against.

For example, to run a test against `10.0.1.1` which has a listening
iperf3 daemon:

```bash
echo "10.0.1.1" | nc <addr> 8675
```

- `/cpu-plotter`

Works together with an `iperf-sender-9000` to trigger incoming iperf3
tests and then measures cpu usage for the duration of the test.

- `/v2`

A program for measuring TCP latency and throughput via qperf and
iperf3 respectively. Written in bash and much less terrible than the
venerable `/v1`.

- `/v1`

A program that does what `/v2` does but in a worse way.
