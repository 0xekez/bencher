Benchmarking code for multicloud measurements.

`config.toml` contains configuration information that the benchmarking
code reads in and uses. Requests are made at a rate of 24 per day. By
default they will download a 10mb file from the target ip address via
the public and private ip address and log information about it to the
log files.

All log entries are in the form `<ms since epoch>, <data>` and
enteries are seperated by newline characters. For error logs, `<data>`
is a message about the type of error that occured. For timing logs
`<data>` is the number of ms that the file request took.

There are two branches in this repo called `vpcone` and `vpctwo` that
the ec2 instances in our VPCs use to store their unique `config.toml`
files. Otherwise they are the same as `main`.

Each ec2 instance runs a public webserver that you can access by
visiting `<instance ip>:8000`. There is a barebones html file there
that has links to the log files for monitoring.

## Building

You'll need a c compiler and openssl-dev. If you don't have those
you'll get errors during the build about a missing libc library and
openssl install.

To build:

```
cargo build --release
```

To run and start sending / receiving requests:

```
cargo run --release
```

Note that it is important to build and run in release mode as the http
server library we're using will not accept external connections in
debug mode.
